#Task Group_4:

The Project Dashboard allows users to manage projects by adding, editing, viewing, and deleting projects.
It also includes the feature of viewing sent messages for communication and deleting unwanted messages.

The portfolio project displays various projects and includes a hero section that contains a personal photo and his field of work,
and a section about describing the owner of the portfolio. It also contains a Contact Us section for communication.



To run two React Vite projects uploaded to GitHub in one repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository containing both React projects:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HindAljendy/Task_Group_4.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the directory of the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd Task_Group_4
   ```

3. Navigate into the directory of the first React project (let's say project1):
   ```
   cd Dashbord
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies for project1:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the development server for project1:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open a new terminal or command prompt window.

7. Navigate back to the main directory of the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd ..
   ```

8. Navigate into the directory of the second React project (let's say project2):
   ```
   cd Portfolio_Task
   ```

9. Install the required dependencies for project2:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

10. Start the development server for project2:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

By following these steps, you can run both React Vite projects located within specific folders in one repository from GitHub.
